Exercise 1:
Accurate measurement of body fat is inconvenient/costly and it is desirable to have easy methods of predicting Body Fat. Using the Body Fat dataset, write a Neural Network to predict body fat:
a. Number of Hidden layers = 3 and number of units are 128,64,32
b. Use RELU activation function, let learning rate be 0.1
Spit the data into (80,20) split and tabulate the performance in terms of RMSE for100 epochs and comment on performance.
The attributes of the dataset are :
1. Density determined from underwater weighing
2. Percent body fat from Siri's (1956) equation
3. Age (years)
4. Weight (lbs)
5. Height (inches)
6. Neck circumference (cm)
7. Chest circumference (cm)
8. Abdomen 2 circumference (cm)
9. Hip circumference (cm)
10. Thigh circumference (cm)
11. Knee circumference (cm)
12. Ankle circumference (cm)
13. Biceps (extended) circumference (cm)
14. Forearm circumference (cm)
15. Wrist circumference (cm)
